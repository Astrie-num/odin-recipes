            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <br>
        
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Optional toppings: maple syrup, fresh fruits, chocolate chips, or whipped cream
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then stir in the milk and melted butter or vegetable oil.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients while stirring, until a smooth batter forms. Do not overmix; small lumps are okay.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    Pour a quarter cup of batter onto the hot skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil to the skillet as needed.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    Serve the pancakes hot, optionally topping them with maple syrup, fresh fruits, chocolate chips, or whipped cream according to your preference.
                </li>
