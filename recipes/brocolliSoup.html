            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup milk or cream</li>

                 minutes until they start to soften slightly.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, ensuring the broccoli is fully covered.
